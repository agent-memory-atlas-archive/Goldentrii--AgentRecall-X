/**
 * retier.ts — evolution p4 (Phase 4): the soft-constraint ladder,
 * `ar corrections retier`.
 *
 * WHY: `severity` (p0/p1) is a binary, capture-time, NEVER-revisited label —
 * once a rule is p0 it stays hard-enforced forever even if its evidence
 * (heeded/recurred/retrieved) never shows up again. "Rules must die unless
 * data renews them": this module adds a THREE-tier ladder — gate (hard
 * enforcement) / nudge (advisory) / watch (background) — computed FRESH
 * from each record's own evidence, plus an automatic, reversible one-step
 * DEMOTION when that evidence goes stale. Nothing here ever deletes,
 * retracts, or archives a record — see CONSTRAINTS below.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * tierOf — HAND-TUNED v1 formula (every constant named + justified; not fit
 * to any labeled outcome set, same "chosen by feel" status as activation.ts's
 * S_DECAY/ACT_ALPHA)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   gate:  severity p0 AND proof_confidence ≥ GATE_MIN_PROOF_CONFIDENCE (0.7)
 *          AND retrieved within GATE_RETRIEVED_WITHIN_DAYS (30d) of asOfDay.
 *   nudge: (severity p0 that did NOT meet gate)                      — OR —
 *          (severity p1 AND proof_confidence ≥ NUDGE_P1_MIN_PROOF_CONFIDENCE
 *           (0.6) AND retrieved within NUDGE_RETRIEVED_WITHIN_DAYS (60d)).
 *   watch: everything else.
 *
 * `proof_confidence` is read directly off the record (it is already the
 * Beta posterior `(heeded+1)/(heeded+recurred+2)` when outcomes exist, and
 * already falls back to `weight` when they don't — see corrections.ts's
 * `applyCorrectionDefaults`/`recordOutcome`). `proofConfidenceOf` below adds
 * ONE more defensive fallback layer (mirroring `decayClassOf`/
 * `effectiveConfidenceOf`'s established defensive posture in corrections.ts)
 * for a raw/un-defaulted record a caller hands in directly (e.g. a truth-
 * table test fixture) rather than one that went through `readCorrections()`.
 *
 * COLD-START (stated explicitly, per the brief): a fresh record that has
 * NEVER been retrieved (`last_retrieved` absent) fails BOTH the gate's and
 * the nudge-p1-branch's retrieval-recency clause regardless of its
 * `proof_confidence` (which for a truly fresh record is `weight`'s prior —
 * ≈1.0 for p0, ≈0.7 for p1 — NOT literally 0.5; the brief's "prior≈0.5"
 * describes the SHAPE of the argument, not a required literal value, and
 * the derivation below holds for ANY confidence value, 0.5 included, since
 * the p0-nudge branch never even reads confidence). Mechanically:
 *   - a fresh P0 record: gate fails (retrieval clause) → falls to the
 *     UNCONDITIONAL "severity p0 not meeting gate" nudge branch → **nudge**.
 *   - a fresh P1 record: gate fails (wrong severity) → nudge's p1 branch
 *     ALSO fails (retrieval clause) → **watch**.
 * This is not a special case coded separately — it is what the formula
 * above already produces for any record with `last_retrieved` absent; it is
 * called out here (and pinned by a truth-table test row) because it is the
 * single most consequential behavior an operator needs to know before
 * trusting the ladder on a corpus with many never-yet-retrieved corrections.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * demotionOf — automatic, one-step-down triggers (pure)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fires independently of (and can pull a record BELOW) the raw `tierOf`
 * result — this is what keeps a P0 record that is technically "not meeting
 * gate" (and would therefore sit at "nudge" forever per the formula above,
 * regardless of HOW stale it gets — the p0-nudge branch has no recency
 * clause of its own) from getting stuck at nudge indefinitely once it goes
 * genuinely dormant.
 *   - `not_violated_plateau`: `not_violated_count ≥ DEMOTE_NOT_VIOLATED_MIN`
 *     (3) AND `heeded_count === 0 && recurrence_count === 0`. DOCUMENTED
 *     APPROXIMATION: the brief's literal spec is "zero heeded/recurred IN
 *     THE LAST 60 DAYS", but `recordOutcome` (storage/corrections.ts)
 *     stamps `last_outcome` for heeded, recurred, AND not_violated alike —
 *     one shared timestamp, no per-kind history — so a record-only pure
 *     function (no ledger read) cannot distinguish "heeded happened but was
 *     >60d ago" from "heeded never happened". This checks lifetime-zero
 *     instead, which is a STRICT SUBSET of the windowed check (every record
 *     lifetime-zero-heeded/recurred is trivially also windowed-zero; a
 *     record with e.g. `heeded_count:1` whose one heeded event happened
 *     400 days ago would satisfy the brief's literal windowed spec but is
 *     SKIPPED here). Flagged, not silently narrowed: a ledger-precision
 *     windowed version would need `readOutcomeEventsByCorrection`, which is
 *     a different function's job, not this pure per-record one's.
 *   - `retrieval_stale_90d`: no retrieval touch within
 *     `DEMOTE_RETRIEVAL_STALE_DAYS` (90) of `asOfDay`. Anchor is
 *     `last_retrieved ?? date` (record creation date) — mirrors
 *     `isStaleCorrection`'s existing `last_retrieved ?? last_outcome ?? date`
 *     touch-anchor convention in corrections.ts, narrowed to retrieval-only
 *     (not outcome) because the brief names "no RETRIEVED event"
 *     specifically. Falling back to `date` (never `last_outcome`) means a
 *     record created 5 days ago with zero retrievals does NOT yet trigger
 *     this — there has not been a 90-day WINDOW in which retrieval could
 *     have happened, so there is nothing to call "stale" yet. `currentTier
 *     === "watch"` short-circuits to `[]` — watch is the floor; there is no
 *     lower tier to step down to, so computing triggers for it is a no-op
 *     it can skip announcing.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * archiveCandidates / promoteToGateCandidates — PROPOSALS ONLY
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Both are pure REPORTS, read by `--dry-run` (and always computed, never
 * gated behind the flag — `--write` just additionally persists tiers).
 * Neither list is ever applied, retracted, or archived by this module or by
 * `--write` — there is no `--apply-proposals` flag anywhere in this file.
 * `archiveCandidates`: watch-tier records with no retrieval/outcome/
 * prediction touch of ANY kind in `ARCHIVE_STALE_DAYS` (180) days — a human
 * decides whether "dormant this long" means retract, keep watching, or
 * something else; this module has no opinion past surfacing the list.
 * `promoteToGateCandidates`: records where the RAW formula (`tierOf`) says
 * "gate", NO demotion trigger fires for that same record (`demotionOf`
 * re-checked internally — see FIX note on the function itself: a raw-gate
 * record whose `not_violated_plateau`/`retrieval_stale_90d` trigger is
 * active is NOT a candidate, because `--write` would persist it one step
 * BELOW gate, not at gate — see `final_tier` below), and the record's
 * LAST-PERSISTED `tier` field disagrees (absent, or a lower tier — this can
 * happen legitimately: a record demoted for staleness gets freshly
 * retrieved again and its raw formula recovers to "gate" before the next
 * `--write` run catches up). `--write` persists `final_tier` — `tierOf`'s
 * raw result stepped down once if `demotionOf` fired, exactly like every
 * other tier — so a promotion INTO gate is not held back by anything
 * OTHER than that same demotion check (only DEMOTION out of a tier is a
 * separate, escalation-style path; there is no analogous "promotion
 * approval" write-gate here). Inside `runRetier`, this list is additionally
 * computed against each record's tier AS OF the end of this call (the tier
 * `--write` just persisted this run, if any — never the pre-write snapshot;
 * see the `writtenTierThisRun` remap in `runRetier`), so a record `--write`
 * already promoted to gate THIS call is never simultaneously reported as
 * "still pending". What "OWNER-GATED" (the brief's own words for this list)
 * means concretely in v1: this list is the visibility mechanism — a human
 * reviewing `--dry-run` output sees exactly which records are ABOUT TO
 * become (or already are, pending the next --write) gate-tier BEFORE
 * trusting anything downstream to key off `tier==="gate"` automatically. If
 * a future phase wants `--write` to hold gate promotions for explicit human
 * sign-off (a real write-time gate), that is a NEW, separate flag on top of
 * this reporting list, not a silent change to what `--write` does today.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * CHALLENGE resolution — stored `tier` vs. `tierOf()` (read contract)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DECIDED: the stored `CorrectionRecord.tier` field is a WRITE-TIME CACHE,
 * never truth. `tierOf(record, asOfDay)` is the ONE source of truth for
 * "what tier is this record right now" — see the field's own doc comment in
 * storage/corrections.ts. This module's own `promoteToGateCandidates` is the
 * proof this is load-bearing, not decorative: it exists BECAUSE the cached
 * field can legitimately disagree with a fresh computation. The
 * session_start rendering tag (goal 3) recomputes fresh at render time for
 * the same reason — it never reads `record.tier`. Storing nothing at all
 * (compute-on-every-read, everywhere) was the alternative considered and
 * REJECTED: `--dry-run`'s whole value proposition is showing "stored vs.
 * computed" drift (the CLI table's `current` column) and idempotency proof
 * needs SOMETHING durable to compare a second `--write` run against; a
 * cache with a documented, enforced "never trust me without recomputing"
 * contract gets both without inventing a second source of truth for any
 * consumer that matters (there is exactly one: `promoteToGateCandidates`,
 * and it already treats the field as a stale-vs-fresh SIGNAL, never as an
 * answer on its own).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Determinism / store-root handling
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `runRetier` is deterministic given the same `asOfDay` and unchanged
 * on-disk inputs (project slugs sorted, no wall-clock read once `asOfDay`
 * is fixed). Unlike `association.ts`'s `--store` (which deliberately never
 * mutates the process-global root because it does its OWN raw fs
 * reads/writes), `runRetier`'s `--write` path MUST reuse corrections.ts's
 * locked, atomic, index-regenerating write machinery (`setCorrectionTier`)
 * — the brief's own "sanctioned record-write path under the project lock"
 * requirement — and that machinery is hard-wired to `getRoot()` throughout.
 * Reimplementing lock+atomic-write+index-regen here to avoid a root swap
 * would duplicate exactly the mechanism the brief says to reuse. So this
 * module swaps `setRoot()` for the duration of one `runRetier()` call (only
 * when `storeRoot` is explicitly passed) and restores the PRIOR root in a
 * `finally`, even on throw — see `withStoreRoot` below. This is the SAME
 * mechanism the CLI's pre-existing global `--root` flag already uses
 * (types.ts's `setRoot`), just scoped to one call instead of the whole
 * process lifetime.
