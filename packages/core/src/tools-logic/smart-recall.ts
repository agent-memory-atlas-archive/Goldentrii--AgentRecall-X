/**
 * smart_recall — unified cross-store search. v3.3.14
 *
 * ── WAVE 2 (2026-08-29/30, plywood SOP ecbd4351) ────────────────────────────
 * Internals migrated onto the shared retrieval pipeline
 * (`retrieval/query-memory.ts`'s `queryMemory()`). EXTERNAL CONTRACT
 * UNCHANGED: same `SmartRecallInput`/`SmartRecallResult` shape, same
 * feedback-rating footer, same archive-fallback/bridge/graph-walk behavior.
 * The composition that used to live directly in this file — journalSearch +
 * palaceSearch + recallInsight + archiveSearch, plus the 5 scattered scoring
 * formulas below and the two-stage RRF fusion — now lives in
 * `retrieval/query-memory.ts` as MANDATORY PIPELINE STAGES (fetch ->
 * trust-filter -> tokenize+score -> scope -> rank/fuse -> fence). See that
 * file's header comment for the full CHALLENGE-by-CHALLENGE design reasoning
 * (why scoring stays per-tier/pluggable rather than unified into one formula;
 * how the Wave-1 candidate superset is handled per source; why FENCE is not
 * applied to this surface's per-item fields). This file now owns exactly the
 * smart_recall-SPECIFIC post-pipeline concerns that do not generalize to
 * other future `queryMemory()` consumers: confidence calibration
 * (`calibratedConfidence`), the Beta-feedback multiplier + feedback log, the
 * remote/local backend race + degraded-timeout handling, the Bridge
 * drilldown, and the F4 archive-fallback's confidence GATE (the policy
 * decision of *when* to call `queryArchiveFallback` — its fetch/score logic
 * itself moved to query-memory.ts).
 *
 * The formulas described below (Fix 1-5b) are UNCHANGED in substance — they
 * are simply now implemented in query-memory.ts's per-tier scoring functions
 * and RANK/FUSE stage instead of inline here. Kept as historical/design
 * documentation because the RATIONALE is still exactly why those formulas
 * are what they are.
 *
 * ## Scoring Architecture (why it works this way)
 *
 * ### Problem with the old approach (< v3.3.14): Linear Score Fusion
 * The old formula combined raw scores from different sources directly:
 *   journal_score  = recency * 0.60 + exactness * 0.40
 *   palace_score   = salience * 0.50 + exactness * 0.30 + salience * 0.20
 * This caused journal entries to always win because their recency weight (0.60)
 * produced scores of ~0.57+ for any entry from yesterday, while palace items
 * with salience=0.5 only scored ~0.35+exactness*0.30. Cross-source raw scores
 * are on incompatible scales — combining them directly is mathematically unsound.
 *
 * ### Fix 1: Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
 * Source: Cormack, Clarke & Buettcher (2009); adopted by Elasticsearch, Azure AI Search.
 * Instead of combining raw scores, each source ranks its own items internally,
 * then RRF merges by rank position:
 *   RRF_score(doc) = Σ  1 / (k + rank_i(doc))    where k=60
 * This means journal item at rank 1 and palace item at rank 1 get equal weight (1/61).
 * No source dominates by default. Items appearing in multiple sources get bonus score.
 *
 * ### Fix 2: Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve (source-specific decay)
 * Source: Ebbinghaus (1885); replicated by Murre & Dros (2015, PMC4492928).
 * Formula: R(t) = e^(-t/S), where S = memory strength (days).
 * Different memory types have different S values based on psychological research:
 *   - Journal (episodic, low meaning):      S = 2    → 60% retained after 1 day
 *   - Palace/decisions (semantic):          S = 9999 → barely decays
 *   - Insight (conceptual): not time-based; uses confirmation count instead
 * This replaces the uniform 0.95^days that treated all memory equally.
 *
 * ### Fix 3: Beta Distribution for Feedback Utility
 * Source: Bayesian statistics; optimal for binary feedback signals.
 * Each item maintains (positives, negatives) feedback counts.
 * Beta expected value: E[β] = (α) / (α + β) = (pos+1) / (pos+neg+2)
 * This is the mathematically optimal Bayesian estimate of "true usefulness":
 *   - No feedback:      E = 0.5  → neutral (no bias)
 *   - 3 positive:       E = 0.8  → meaningful boost
 *   - 5 negative:       E = 0.14 → meaningful penalty
 * Applied as a multiplier to RRF score: finalScore = rrfScore * (E * 2)
 * (×2 so neutral = 1.0, positive = >1.0, negative = <1.0)
 *
 * ### Fix 4: Consistent total_searched
 * Previously mixed "total matches" (palace), "returned results" (journal),
 * and "total in index" (insight) — three different metrics summed together.
 * Counts candidate items from each source before final RRF merge — genuinely,
 * via a raw-candidate-count side channel localRecallSearch attaches to its
 * return value (see Fix 5; `total_searched` is NOT `results.length`, which is
 * a post-fusion count and can legitimately be smaller).
 *
 * ### Fix 5: Canonical cross-source fusion, in two stages (v3.4.39)
 * applyRRF() used to key its ONLY fusion map by a PER-SOURCE occurrence id —
 * `stableId(source, title)`, where `title` is built differently per source
 * (palace: "room/file", journal: "date / section"). The SAME conceptual
 * memory found via two sources therefore got two DIFFERENT ids and landed in
 * two separate map entries, so cross-source RRF accumulation
 * (`existing.score += contribution`) could never fire — only within-source
 * duplicates (same id) could. A later "dedup by excerpt" pass then silently
 * collapsed same-excerpt entries by first-inserted-wins, DISCARDING the other
 * source's score entirely instead of summing it in.
 * Fix: fusion is now TWO stages. Stage 1 (applyRRF, keyed by `item.id`) still
 * consolidates multiple hits from the SAME source document. Stage 2
 * (fuseCanonical) then re-keys those already-consolidated per-document
 * entries by NORMALIZED EXCERPT CONTENT. Provenance from every contributing
 * source is preserved via `alsoFoundIn` on the fused item, rather than being
 * dropped. (Both stages live in query-memory.ts now — see that file's
 * `applyRRF`/`fuseCanonical`.)
 *
 * ### Fix 5b: insight excerpt is too low-entropy to be a fusion identity
 * Stage 2's "normalized excerpt content" identity assumption (Fix 5) is
 * sound for palace/journal, whose `excerpt` is a real matched text snippet.
 * It was broken for the insight source: its excerpt was synthesized from
 * ONLY `severity` + `applies_when`, omitting the insight's own distinguishing
 * `title` entirely. Fix: insight items now carry a separate `fusionKey`
 * (`${title} [severity] tags`) that fuseCanonical() and the defensive dedup
 * pass key on INSTEAD of `excerpt` when present.

/**
 * remote-fusion wave #24 (2026-09-09) — rank-based RRF fusion of the local
 * keyword-search results and the remote (Supabase) semantic-search results.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS FIXES: today, `smartRecall()`'s remote path is
 * `results = remoteResults.length > 0 ? remoteResults : localResults` — the
 * moment the remote backend answers with ANY non-empty result set, the ENTIRE
 * local result set is discarded, even a genuine local-only hit the remote
 * backend simply missed (e.g. a very recent journal entry not yet
 * embedded/synced to Supabase — sync is fire-and-forget, see `sync.ts`'s
 * `syncToSupabase()`). This function merges instead of replacing.
 *
 * RANK-BASED, NEVER RAW-SCORE (see this file's header, Fix 1, and
 * confidence.ts's own header for the bug class this avoids): local's native
 * score scale (~0..0.12, a 3-tier internal RRF) and remote's (~0..0.049, a
 * 3-leg internal RRF, itself already re-labeled through a THIRD "cosine"/
 * "rrf-supabase" scale) are mutually incompatible — summing them directly
 * would let one origin systematically dominate, exactly the
 * cross-source-raw-score-averaging bug this codebase has already fixed once.
 * So neither list's `.score` is read here — only each item's RANK (its
 * position within its OWN already-sorted list) feeds the RRF contribution
 * `1/(FUSION_RRF_K+rank)`, the identical formula `query-memory.ts`'s
 * `applyRRF` uses one layer down (there: fusing TIERS; here: fusing
 * BACKENDS).
 *
 * ON A DUP (same `fusionIdentity()`): the LOCAL item's fields ALWAYS win —
 * richer (real trust-filtered annotations: `supersededBy`/`conflictsWith`,
 * match-anchored excerpt, `verbatimKey` for the Bridge) — only `.score` is
 * replaced (the summed RRF contribution, used for this array's own sort
 * order) and `foundInRemote` is set. `.confidence`/`.calibrated` are NEVER
 * recomputed here: they stay exactly whatever the SURVIVING item's own
 * origin already computed them as at ITS OWN scoring time (local items:
 * "rrf-local" scale, set in `localRecallSearch`; remote-only items: "cosine"/
 * "rrf-supabase", set in `recall-backend.ts`'s row mappers) — this is the
 * safest possible way to keep `calibrated` correctly scaled to each item's
 * ORIGIN: never re-deriving it from the new blended rank-score at all means
 * it can never be accidentally run through the WRONG scale (Risk #8,
 * confidence.ts's own header — the exact hazard this satisfies rather than
 * reintroduces).
 *
 * Both input lists are assumed already rank-sorted (best first) — exactly
 * what `localRecallSearch()`'s and `SupabaseRecallBackend.search()`'s own
 * return values already are. Each input list is ALSO assumed to already be
 * internally deduped (unique `fusionIdentity()` within its own list) —
 * true today for both origins (`SupabaseRecallBackend.search()` already
 * dedupes by id then by normalized excerpt before returning;
 * `localRecallSearch()`'s own pipeline dedupes via `fuseCanonical()`). If
 * that precondition were ever violated, a second same-identity item WITHIN
 * one origin's own list would fold into the FIRST-seen item's map entry
 * (same-origin collision, not a cross-origin one) — for a remote-side
 * collision this would incorrectly leave `foundInRemote` at its default
 * `false` (the field's own contract is "found in the OTHER origin", not
 * "found more than once"); not a live bug given the precondition above, but
 * worth knowing if either origin's own de-dup is ever relaxed.
